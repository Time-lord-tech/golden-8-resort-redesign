## Corpus Check
- 35 files · ~638,031 words
- Verdict: corpus is large enough that graph structure adds value.

## Summary
- 179 nodes · 194 edges · 15 communities (14 shown, 1 thin omitted)
- Extraction: 100% EXTRACTED · 0% INFERRED · 0% AMBIGUOUS

## Graph Freshness
- Built from commit: `3b196ba5`
- Run `git rev-parse HEAD` and compare to check if the graph is stale.
- Run `graphify update .` after code changes (no API cost).

## Knowledge Gaps
- **93 isolated node(s):** `name`, `private`, `version`, `type`, `dev` (+88 more)
  These have ≤1 connection - possible missing edges or undocumented components.
- **1 thin communities (<3 nodes) omitted from report** — run `graphify query` to explore isolated nodes.

## Suggested Questions
_Questions this graph is uniquely positioned to answer:_

- **Why does `devDependencies` connect `Community 3` to `Community 5`?**
  _High betweenness centrality (0.019) - this node is a cross-community bridge._
- **What connects `name`, `private`, `version` to the rest of the system?**
  _93 weakly-connected nodes found - possible documentation gaps or missing edges._
- **Should `Community 0` be split into smaller, more focused modules?**
  _Cohesion score 0.09090909090909091 - nodes in this community are weakly interconnected._
- **Should `Community 1` be split into smaller, more focused modules?**
  _Cohesion score 0.05873015873015873 - nodes in this community are weakly interconnected._
- **Should `Community 2` be split into smaller, more focused modules?**
  _Cohesion score 0.1 - nodes in this community are weakly interconnected._
- **Should `Community 4` be split into smaller, more focused modules?**
  _Cohesion score 0.11396011396011396 - nodes in this community are weakly interconnected._
- **Should `Community 5` be split into smaller, more focused modules?**
